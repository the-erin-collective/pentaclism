# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Pentaclism is a real-time strategy game set on a hostile planet where five distinct factions compete for dominance through surface and underground expansion. Each faction is built around one of the five Platonic solids, creating unique gameplay tempos, visual identities, and strategic approaches. The game emphasizes faction asymmetry, underground expansion mechanics, and a five-resource economy system that drives meaningful strategic choices.

The core innovation lies in the Platonic Tempo Curve - where the number of faces on each faction's geometric symbol directly correlates to their complexity and intended win timing, from the chaotic 4-face Tetrahedron rush faction to the methodical 20-face Icosahedron late-game powerhouse.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Faction System with Platonic Solid Identity
